When I'm feelin' Blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
Then I'm not so Blue
When you're close to me
I can feel your heart beat, I can hear you breathing in my ear

Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love

Anytime you want to, you can turn me on to
Anything you want to, anytime at all
When I kiss your lips
Ohw, I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside

Wouldn't you agree? Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love

Ohhhw

When I'm feelin' Blue
All I have to do is take a look at you
Then I'm not so Blue
When I'm in your arms, nothin' seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I don't care

Wouldn't you agree? Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
Ohhh

We got a groovy kind of love
