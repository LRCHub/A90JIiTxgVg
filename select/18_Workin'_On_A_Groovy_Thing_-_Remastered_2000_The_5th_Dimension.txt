When I saw you I knew that I was gonna love you
And everyday I thought of how I'm gonna love you
Now you're here next to me
And ecstasy is a reality
I feel good when you are near
I'm alive cause you are here
Working on a groovy thing baby
Working on a groovy thing
Working on a groovy thing baby
Let's not rush in we'll take it slow
Before I met you I know my lips were only wasted
'Cause you have got the sweetest kiss I ever tasted
Music moves us along
Your arms around me are snug and warm
Happiness is in my soul
I'm about to lose all control
Working on a groovy thing baby
Working on a groovy thing
Working on a groovy thing baby
Let's not rush in we'll take it slow
Working on a groovy thing
